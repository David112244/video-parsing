00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
canal treatment and whilst I'm waiting
 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.870 align:start position:0%
canal treatment and whilst I'm waiting
for<00:06:47.199><c> that</c><00:06:47.280><c> to</c><00:06:47.400><c> be</c><00:06:47.520><c> done</c><00:06:47.800><c> I</c><00:06:47.880><c> am</c><00:06:48.000><c> on</c><00:06:48.240><c> antibiotic</c>

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
for that to be done I am on antibiotic
 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
for that to be done I am on antibiotic
so<00:06:48.960><c> I</c><00:06:49.080><c> literally</c><00:06:49.440><c> started</c><00:06:49.720><c> taking</c><00:06:49.960><c> them</c><00:06:50.120><c> today</c>

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
so I literally started taking them today
 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.350 align:start position:0%
so I literally started taking them today
uh<00:06:51.080><c> the</c><00:06:51.199><c> day</c><00:06:51.360><c> of</c><00:06:51.479><c> this</c><00:06:51.639><c> session</c><00:06:51.919><c> I</c><00:06:52.000><c> was</c><00:06:52.120><c> a</c><00:06:52.199><c> bit</c>

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh the day of this session I was a bit
 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh the day of this session I was a bit
worried<00:06:52.759><c> because</c><00:06:53.120><c> my</c><00:06:53.240><c> mouth's</c><00:06:53.599><c> been</c><00:06:53.800><c> hurting</c>

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
worried because my mouth's been hurting
 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
worried because my mouth's been hurting
and<00:06:54.680><c> obviously</c><00:06:55.680><c> no</c><00:06:55.879><c> idea</c><00:06:56.120><c> if</c><00:06:56.280><c> antibiotics</c><00:06:56.840><c> are</c>

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
and obviously no idea if antibiotics are
 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.189 align:start position:0%
and obviously no idea if antibiotics are
meant<00:06:57.080><c> to</c><00:06:57.280><c> affect</c><00:06:57.520><c> you</c><00:06:57.720><c> physically</c><00:06:58.240><c> but</c><00:06:59.039><c> I</c>

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
meant to affect you physically but I
 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.469 align:start position:0%
meant to affect you physically but I
like<00:06:59.360><c> to</c><00:06:59.680><c> fly</c><00:06:59.960><c> in</c><00:07:00.080><c> the</c><00:07:00.280><c> face</c><00:07:00.720><c> of</c><00:07:01.039><c> Medical</c>

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
like to fly in the face of Medical
 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:02.909 align:start position:0%
like to fly in the face of Medical
Science<00:07:02.000><c> um</c><00:07:02.120><c> I</c><00:07:02.199><c> thought</c><00:07:02.319><c> I'd</c><00:07:02.479><c> just</c><00:07:02.599><c> go</c><00:07:02.720><c> for</c><00:07:02.800><c> it</c>

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
Science um I thought I'd just go for it
 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.270 align:start position:0%
Science um I thought I'd just go for it
anyway<00:07:03.120><c> and</c><00:07:03.199><c> I</c><00:07:03.319><c> actually</c><00:07:03.520><c> felt</c><00:07:03.800><c> fine</c><00:07:04.000><c> it</c><00:07:04.080><c> was</c>

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
anyway and I actually felt fine it was
 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.710 align:start position:0%
anyway and I actually felt fine it was
kind<00:07:04.400><c> of</c><00:07:04.560><c> probably</c><00:07:04.759><c> more</c><00:07:04.919><c> of</c><00:07:05.039><c> a</c><00:07:05.199><c> mental</c><00:07:05.520><c> thing</c>

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
kind of probably more of a mental thing
 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.110 align:start position:0%
kind of probably more of a mental thing
than<00:07:05.840><c> anything</c><00:07:06.199><c> so</c><00:07:06.879><c> hopefully</c><00:07:07.240><c> I've</c><00:07:07.360><c> got</c><00:07:07.720><c> five</c>

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
than anything so hopefully I've got five
 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.710 align:start position:0%
than anything so hopefully I've got five
days<00:07:08.319><c> of</c><00:07:08.520><c> antibiotics</c><00:07:09.160><c> then</c><00:07:09.280><c> I'll</c><00:07:09.400><c> be</c><00:07:09.520><c> getting</c>

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
days of antibiotics then I'll be getting
 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.189 align:start position:0%
days of antibiotics then I'll be getting
the<00:07:09.800><c> root</c><00:07:10.039><c> canal</c><00:07:10.360><c> done</c><00:07:10.560><c> fairly</c><00:07:10.879><c> soon</c><00:07:11.759><c> uh</c><00:07:11.879><c> so</c>

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
the root canal done fairly soon uh so
 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.350 align:start position:0%
the root canal done fairly soon uh so
hopefully<00:07:12.520><c> none</c><00:07:12.639><c> of</c><00:07:12.759><c> that's</c><00:07:12.879><c> going</c><00:07:12.960><c> to</c><00:07:13.120><c> affect</c>

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully none of that's going to affect
 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.589 align:start position:0%
hopefully none of that's going to affect
anything<00:07:13.599><c> I'll</c><00:07:13.720><c> just</c><00:07:13.840><c> try</c><00:07:14.000><c> and</c><00:07:14.199><c> get</c><00:07:14.360><c> stuff</c>

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
anything I'll just try and get stuff
 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:15.629 align:start position:0%
anything I'll just try and get stuff
done<00:07:14.879><c> you</c>

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
done you
 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.830 align:start position:0%
done you
know<00:07:16.639><c> irrespective</c><00:07:17.199><c> of</c><00:07:17.319><c> what's</c><00:07:17.520><c> going</c><00:07:17.639><c> on</c>

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
know irrespective of what's going on
 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.350 align:start position:0%
know irrespective of what's going on
there<00:07:18.120><c> because</c><00:07:19.120><c> let's</c><00:07:19.360><c> face</c><00:07:19.560><c> it</c><00:07:19.960><c> it'll</c><00:07:20.160><c> be</c>

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
there because let's face it it'll be
 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.710 align:start position:0%
there because let's face it it'll be
pretty<00:07:20.759><c> ridiculous</c><00:07:21.240><c> to</c><00:07:21.360><c> let</c><00:07:21.520><c> a</c><00:07:21.639><c> tooth</c><00:07:22.199><c> affect</c>

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
pretty ridiculous to let a tooth affect
 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.909 align:start position:0%
pretty ridiculous to let a tooth affect

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
my uh training and my gains so I'm not
 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.830 align:start position:0%
my uh training and my gains so I'm not
going<00:07:26.039><c> to</c><00:07:26.160><c> let</c><00:07:26.319><c> it</c><00:07:26.479><c> and</c><00:07:26.639><c> if</c><00:07:26.759><c> it</c><00:07:27.000><c> does</c><00:07:27.479><c> start</c><00:07:27.680><c> to</c>

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to let it and if it does start to
 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
going to let it and if it does start to
become<00:07:28.080><c> an</c><00:07:28.240><c> issue</c><00:07:29.160><c> I</c><00:07:29.319><c> will</c><00:07:29.560><c> will</c>

become an issue I will will
 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.510 align:start position:0%
become an issue I will will
potentially

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
like like a freezer helmet so it just
 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.629 align:start position:0%
like like a freezer helmet so it just

really iffy like no kind of close ones
they<00:07:58.479><c> all</c><00:07:58.639><c> felt</c><00:07:59.560><c> pretty</c><00:07:59.879><c> good</c><00:08:00.639><c> um</c><00:08:00.720><c> and</c><00:08:00.840><c> then</c>

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
they all felt pretty good um and then
 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.149 align:start position:0%
they all felt pretty good um and then
