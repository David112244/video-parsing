00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
Good morning.  Hello.  So,
 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.230 align:start position:0%
Good morning.  Hello.  So,
let's <00:00:09.453><c>start </c><00:00:10.426><c>with </c><00:00:11.399><c>exactly</c>

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
let's start with exactly
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.350 align:start position:0%
let's start with exactly
what <00:00:12.453><c>is </c><00:00:12.666><c>happening </c><00:00:12.879><c>at </c><00:00:13.092><c>the </c><00:00:13.305><c>front </c><00:00:13.518><c>in </c><00:00:13.731><c>general?  </c><00:00:13.944><c>Is </c><00:00:14.157><c>there</c>

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
what is happening at the front in general?  Is there
 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.070 align:start position:0%
what is happening at the front in general?  Is there
any <00:00:14.780><c>movement?  </c><00:00:15.200><c>And </c><00:00:15.620><c>in </c><00:00:16.040><c>general </c><00:00:16.460><c>there </c><00:00:16.880><c>is</c>

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
any movement?  And in general there is
 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.029 align:start position:0%
any movement?  And in general there is
an <00:00:17.425><c>impression </c><00:00:17.770><c>that </c><00:00:18.115><c>the </c><00:00:18.460><c>front </c><00:00:18.805><c>has </c><00:00:19.150><c>become </c><00:00:19.495><c>quiet.  </c><00:00:19.840><c>Ah,</c>

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
an impression that the front has become quiet.  Ah,
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.750 align:start position:0%
an impression that the front has become quiet.  Ah,
but <00:00:20.559><c>somehow, </c><00:00:21.079><c>uh, </c><00:00:21.599><c>I </c><00:00:22.119><c>have </c><00:00:22.639><c>a</c>

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
but somehow, uh, I have a
 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.070 align:start position:0%
but somehow, uh, I have a
suspicion <00:00:22.969><c>that </c><00:00:23.178><c>this </c><00:00:23.387><c>impression </c><00:00:23.596><c>is</c>

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
suspicion that this impression is
 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.070 align:start position:0%
suspicion that this impression is
deceptive.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
deceptive.
 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.589 align:start position:0%
deceptive.
Ah, <00:00:26.354><c>indeed, </c><00:00:26.628><c>well, </c><00:00:26.902><c>to </c><00:00:27.176><c>a </c><00:00:27.450><c>certain </c><00:00:27.724><c>extent </c><00:00:27.998><c>it </c><00:00:28.272><c>is</c>

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
Ah, indeed, well, to a certain extent it is
 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.429 align:start position:0%
Ah, indeed, well, to a certain extent it is
deceptive, <00:00:28.919><c>of </c><00:00:29.239><c>course.</c>

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
deceptive, of course.
 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
deceptive, of course.
Because <00:00:30.739><c>the </c><00:00:31.039><c>front </c><00:00:31.339><c>line </c><00:00:31.639><c>is </c><00:00:31.939><c>changing </c><00:00:32.239><c>very</c>

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
Because the front line is changing very
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.310 align:start position:0%
Because the front line is changing very
slowly, <00:00:32.852><c>but </c><00:00:33.145><c>it </c><00:00:33.438><c>is </c><00:00:33.731><c>changing.  </c><00:00:34.024><c>It </c><00:00:34.317><c>is </c><00:00:34.610><c>impossible </c><00:00:34.903><c>to </c><00:00:35.196><c>say</c>

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
slowly, but it is changing.  It is impossible to say
 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.270 align:start position:0%
slowly, but it is changing.  It is impossible to say
that <00:00:35.871><c>the </c><00:00:36.422><c>fighting </c><00:00:36.973><c>has </c><00:00:37.524><c>died </c><00:00:38.075><c>down,</c>

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
that the fighting has died down,
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.750 align:start position:0%
that the fighting has died down,
because <00:00:40.440><c>it</c>

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
because it
 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.110 align:start position:0%
because it
continues, <00:00:41.100><c>and </c><00:00:41.440><c>the </c><00:00:41.780><c>intensity </c><00:00:42.120><c>is</c>

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
continues, and the intensity is
 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.229 align:start position:0%
continues, and the intensity is
really <00:00:43.750><c>quite </c><00:00:44.380><c>high.  </c><00:00:45.010><c>And </c><00:00:45.640><c>the</c>

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
really quite high.  And the
 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.110 align:start position:0%
really quite high.  And the
Russian <00:00:46.612><c>troops </c><00:00:46.985><c>are </c><00:00:47.358><c>advancing, </c><00:00:47.731><c>trying </c><00:00:48.104><c>to </c><00:00:48.477><c>advance</c>

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
Russian troops are advancing, trying to advance
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.189 align:start position:0%
Russian troops are advancing, trying to advance
, <00:00:49.600><c>so </c><00:00:50.080><c>to </c><00:00:50.560><c>speak, </c><00:00:51.040><c>and </c><00:00:51.520><c>where </c><00:00:52.000><c>they</c>

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
, so to speak, and where they
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.189 align:start position:0%
, so to speak, and where they
succeed, <00:00:53.479><c>they </c><00:00:54.759><c>advance</c>

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
succeed, they advance
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.470 align:start position:0%
succeed, they advance
very <00:00:55.639><c>slowly, </c><00:00:56.079><c>but </c><00:00:56.519><c>nevertheless </c><00:00:56.959><c>they</c>

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
very slowly, but nevertheless they
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.869 align:start position:0%
very slowly, but nevertheless they
advance.  <00:00:58.199><c>So, </c><00:00:58.918><c>well, </c><00:00:59.637><c>I </c><00:01:00.356><c>think</c>

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 align:start position:0%
advance.  So, well, I think
 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.910 align:start position:0%
advance.  So, well, I think
that <00:01:01.374><c>talking </c><00:01:01.869><c>about </c><00:01:02.364><c>the </c><00:01:02.859><c>entire </c><00:01:03.354><c>front, </c><00:01:03.849><c>that </c><00:01:04.344><c>is, </c><00:01:04.839><c>in</c>

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
that talking about the entire front, that is, in
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 align:start position:0%
that talking about the entire front, that is, in
the <00:01:05.188><c>course </c><00:01:05.456><c>of </c><00:01:05.724><c>one </c><00:01:05.992><c>of </c><00:01:06.260><c>our </c><00:01:06.528><c>issues, </c><00:01:06.796><c>is</c>

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
the course of one of our issues, is
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
the course of one of our issues, is
probably <00:01:08.219><c>not </c><00:01:08.639><c>very </c><00:01:09.059><c>correct, </c><00:01:09.479><c>because</c>

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
probably not very correct, because
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.070 align:start position:0%
probably not very correct, because
it <00:01:09.830><c>will </c><00:01:09.980><c>be </c><00:01:10.130><c>such </c><00:01:10.280><c>a</c>

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
it will be such a
 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.270 align:start position:0%
it will be such a
very, <00:01:12.615><c>very, </c><00:01:13.150><c>I </c><00:01:13.685><c>would </c><00:01:14.220><c>say, </c><00:01:14.755><c>superficial,</c>

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
very, very, I would say, superficial,
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.950 align:start position:0%
very, very, I would say, superficial,


00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
superficial, <00:01:17.386><c>well, </c><00:01:17.812><c>not </c><00:01:18.238><c>even </c><00:01:18.664><c>an </c><00:01:19.090><c>analysis, </c><00:01:19.516><c>but</c>

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
superficial, well, not even an analysis, but
 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.350 align:start position:0%
superficial, well, not even an analysis, but
simply <00:01:20.040><c>a </c><00:01:20.440><c>mention </c><00:01:20.840><c>of </c><00:01:21.240><c>some </c><00:01:21.640><c>villages </c><00:01:22.040><c>or</c>

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
simply a mention of some villages or
 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.190 align:start position:0%
simply a mention of some villages or
directions.  <00:01:23.270><c>Therefore, </c><00:01:24.180><c>I </c><00:01:25.090><c>would </c><00:01:26.000><c>suggest</c>

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
directions.  Therefore, I would suggest
 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.990 align:start position:0%
directions.  Therefore, I would suggest
starting <00:01:26.679><c>today </c><00:01:27.158><c>with </c><00:01:27.637><c>one </c><00:01:28.116><c>of </c><00:01:28.595><c>the </c><00:01:29.074><c>central</c>

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
starting today with one of the central
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.469 align:start position:0%
starting today with one of the central
directions, <00:01:30.415><c>and </c><00:01:30.830><c>then </c><00:01:31.245><c>tomorrow, </c><00:01:31.660><c>the </c><00:01:32.075><c>day </c><00:01:32.490><c>after </c><00:01:32.905><c>tomorrow, </c><00:01:33.320><c>and</c>

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
directions, and then tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and
 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.630 align:start position:0%
directions, and then tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and
so <00:01:35.007><c>on, </c><00:01:35.535><c>meaning, </c><00:01:36.063><c>moving, </c><00:01:36.591><c>trying </c><00:01:37.119><c>to</c>

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
so on, meaning, moving, trying to
 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.069 align:start position:0%
so on, meaning, moving, trying to
concentrate <00:01:38.620><c>on </c><00:01:39.600><c>other</c>

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
concentrate on other
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.990 align:start position:0%
concentrate on other
directions <00:01:40.769><c>today.  </c><00:01:41.459><c>Therefore, </c><00:01:42.149><c>I </c><00:01:42.839><c>would</c>

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
directions today.  Therefore, I would
 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.590 align:start position:0%
directions today.  Therefore, I would
choose the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
choose the
 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.429 align:start position:0%
choose the
Konstantinovsky <00:01:45.460><c>direction.  </c><00:01:46.320><c>Why?</c>

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
Konstantinovsky direction.  Why?
 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.109 align:start position:0%
Konstantinovsky direction.  Why?
Well, <00:01:49.600><c>because</c>

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
Well, because
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.709 align:start position:0%
Well, because
Konstantinovka, <00:01:51.472><c>well, </c><00:01:51.825><c>it </c><00:01:52.178><c>has </c><00:01:52.531><c>long </c><00:01:52.884><c>since </c><00:01:53.237><c>become,</c>

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 align:start position:0%
Konstantinovka, well, it has long since become,
 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.069 align:start position:0%
Konstantinovka, well, it has long since become,
in <00:01:53.939><c>fact, </c><00:01:54.159><c>a</c>

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
Well, <00:07:07.232><c>judging </c><00:07:07.664><c>by </c><00:07:08.096><c>Peskov’s </c><00:07:08.528><c>words, </c><00:07:08.960><c>I</c>

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
Well, judging by Peskov’s words, I
 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.710 align:start position:0%
Well, judging by Peskov’s words, I
think <00:07:09.406><c>that </c><00:07:09.692><c>Peskov </c><00:07:09.978><c>is </c><00:07:10.264><c>not </c><00:07:10.550><c>fantasizing </c><00:07:10.836><c>here;</c>

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
think that Peskov is not fantasizing here;
 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.270 align:start position:0%
think that Peskov is not fantasizing here;
he <00:07:12.115><c>is </c><00:07:12.510><c>expressing </c><00:07:12.905><c>the </c><00:07:13.300><c>point </c><00:07:13.695><c>of </c><00:07:14.090><c>view </c><00:07:14.485><c>of </c><00:07:14.880><c>his </c><00:07:15.275><c>boss.</c>

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
he is expressing the point of view of his boss.
 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.670 align:start position:0%
he is expressing the point of view of his boss.
So, <00:07:17.130><c>Peskov, </c><00:07:17.980><c>this </c><00:07:18.830><c>thing, </c><00:07:19.680><c>I</c>

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
So, Peskov, this thing, I
 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.070 align:start position:0%
So, Peskov, this thing, I
think, <00:07:21.028><c>showed </c><00:07:21.376><c>up </c><00:07:21.724><c>last </c><00:07:22.072><c>night </c><00:07:22.420><c>somewhere </c><00:07:22.768><c>around </c><00:07:23.116><c>6:00</c>

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.950 align:start position:0%

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
around that time.  Well, then he
 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.390 align:start position:0%
around that time.  Well, then he
talked <00:07:31.616><c>about </c><00:07:31.952><c>it </c><00:07:32.288><c>a </c><00:07:32.624><c>little </c><00:07:32.960><c>earlier.</c>
