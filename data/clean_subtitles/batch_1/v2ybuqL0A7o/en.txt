what's up everyone it's ad from bar stars and today I'll be bringing you a one-arm push-up tutorial the one-arm push-up is a very popular exercise move made famous by some people such as rocky bruce lee and jack palance at the oscars so this should go without saying but you shouldn't be training for a one-armed push-up if you can't perform a handful of perfect basic push-ups now my personal reference I will suggest about 20 repetitions of a maximum before moving on this means you're able to complete 20 perfect basic push-ups then you're ready to move on to the harder variation the next variation will be the diamond pushup which gives you a more centered push that's going to help you when it comes to the one-arm pushup once you have to complete a 20 rep maximum then you're able to move on to the next most difficult progression uneven push-ups using a ball or another object place your hand on this assisting object and then perform your push-up having your hands on even with promotor your body's weight towards the hand that's on the floor remember to do both sides to stay balanced that goal is a 10 rep maximum for each hand I in this video use a dollar ball from the 99 cent store advance uneven push-ups so now it's similar to the previous but you want to depend less on the assisting object that means if you have a ball roll it out further extend your arms straighter if the object is stable then move your body away from the object you want to put more the weight onto the dominant hand which is the hand that's being worked you want to do both sides and this time as opposed to the previous exercise you want stay at a low rep range of 3 to 5 and start working toward strength now we're going to start talking about the positioning for the one-arm push-up the wider your legs are the further your feet are perform each other the easier the movement is the closer they are the harder it is because the way leverage works so if you're starting off keep your legs wider open if you're more advanced keep them closer together the first progression in this series is going to be a partial one-arm push-up so you're just focusing on getting one third of the way down and back up as you get stronger go further down now once you get those you should be doing the belly turn one-arm push-ups these are also known as bad form one-armed push-ups because it makes the movement easier being turned to the side like that it allows for your legs to pick up more of the weight and it cuts down the range of motion you could use these as a progression as long as you move towards the more difficult movement now this is the basic one-arm push-up so keeping your belly button down and your back straight you're going to come down and back up someone should be able to place an object on your middle back without it falling all the way down all the way up this is the basic one-arm pushup now here's another set of progressions that I personally did not use but they could be helpful the incline one arm which allows your body to help you more because you're pretty much standing and leaning and as you get stronger you could decline the surface that you're using so here I'm more upright whereas I'm on the bench I'm facing closer to the ground which makes the movement harder I personally never use these but these could be helpful to you every person could have a different path to the same goal thank you guys for watching the video if you have any questions leave them down below and I'll try to answer as many as possible like and share the video if you like our content check out our shop at bar Starcom for additional information apparel and training equipment peace
