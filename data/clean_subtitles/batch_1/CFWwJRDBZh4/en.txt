[music] Hello my dears Today I will show you the correct technique for performing the bench press this is a basic multi-component exercise that should be performed not only by men but also by women with the classic exercise on a flat bench and with a wide hand position the large and small pectoral muscles are worked out the anterior deltoids and triceps let's start with the correct technique for performing the bench press lie down on a horizontal bench so that the bar is exactly above your gaze the back of your head buttocks and shoulder blades are pressed tightly to the bench legs Sherry shoulders and firmly rests on the floor the lower back bends a little you are not a powerlifter and you do not need to pave here for greater concentration on the pectoral muscles you can put your feet on the bench like this prov prot grab the bar with a wide closed grip adjust the position of your hands so that when lowering the bar the angle in your elbows is 90 Â° lower the bar from the stops and press it up Arms straight but not locked elbows so that the load does not fall on the joints and does not pass from the chest to the triceps this is the starting position taking a deep breath lower the bar to the lower part of the chest as soon as the bar touches Lyuda strongly press the bar up and make a powerful exhalation through the mouth lower the bar at a smooth and moderate pace and now about the wrong technique lower the bar to the lower part of the chest and not under the chin or somewhere else grab the bar with a closed grip this is much safer than an open grip lift the bar evenly without wobbling dumbbells or a lighter bar or even a leg should rest firmly on the floor breathe correctly without holding your breath If you are doing this exercise for the first time, then be sure to ask the trainer in the gym to check your technique and in no case do not hesitate to do this exercise because it is supposedly for men because you also want to have a beautiful and toned chest good luck to you and [music] bye N [music]
