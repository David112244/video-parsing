This is English Hello, we continue to revive the English section based on films and today we have another villain Cannibal Lecturer, as you know, the lecturer has a very high intellect, so the words he uses will be extremely interesting and complex. But those that make him sound exactly like a brilliant villain are not that I wanted you to talk like brilliant villains, but nevertheless, it sounds very beautiful when a person has a large vocabulary when he uses more complex, more beautiful words, expressions. It is always pleasant to listen to and always creates a feeling that a person has intelligence. This is what I would also like for you. I remind you that for this lesson, as well as for all the others, there are additional materials at the link in the description of this video, there will be exercises that I have compiled, fill in the blanks, complete sentences, and so on, work with vocabulary so that it remains in your head for a long time, of course, cards for this issue with the most difficult words that you can get on your phone with voice acting and pictures, everything as it should be, at the link in the description, download and I will study so that all the material studied is fixed in your head  reinforced concrete Well, now let's get started I turned on this scene a little bit in advance Where she will still go to her There will be these criminals watching So I hope you are not in a hurry today [music] My Name with ials [ music] Well, here she is greeted in prison the prisoner says I never know what to do with swearing Especially with such in my analysis so let's I will give the floor to your imagination and dictionary Google it yourself but SM is to smell the smell SM I can smell Yes, to sniff like [music] from here So let's start a dialogue right away everything is like in an English club Yes, there are no new words while she is speaking Can I talk to you that is, such a very polite form one of frh like one of his isn't it Can I see your IDs Your documents cral Let's write down Lecturer is a doctor a learned man Therefore, he will have the bulk of interesting words today by the way, they immediately show us all sorts of IDs Rovka you see how politely and he tells her and such  intelligentsia guys definitely of course certain some specific of course definitely Well and when she takes out the documents He tells her closer please too We see here how it happens I Yes mayen closer please closer that expires in One We not FBI are you I 'm Still in Training Ja craw Train Yes Student Here Learn you May you can fori -

This already has to do with courtship if there is C politeness, courtesy, then a polite, polite person, once again, polite, polite, courteous, all the works, politeness, courtesy. Let's write them both down. C politeness, courtesy and polite, and he says to her, you were like this [music] polite - this is accepting, that is, such that could accept and were receptive to politeness, courtesy. That is, he says, we are with you. Yes, you were considerate and you accepted politeness.
