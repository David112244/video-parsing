hey it's robin from the balanced life and i'm gonna lead you through a few quick stretches that you can do at your desk so you can be seated in a chair you can sneak these in throughout your workday anytime you just need a little break to stretch and release tension these are for you so the first one you're gonna start just seated in your chair you might have to push back a little bit from your desk but go ahead and just rest your hands long down by your side take a nice big inhale and this is a seated roll down so you're gonna exhale nod your chin towards your chest and you're just going to allow yourself to roll forward over your thighs slowly roll yourself back up and as you do think of stacking your spine one vertebra at a time bringing your head all the way back over your shoulders so often when we're sitting at a desk we end up forward head right in this rounded position so when you stack back up restore that posture that nice long spine take an inhale and exhale roll forward you can do this stretch as many times as you'd like and just think of stacking that spine and engaging that core as you come back up the second stretch is a seated figure four so you're seated here on your chair you're gonna bring one ankle across your opposite thigh sitting up nice and tall and then from here maybe this is enough of a stretch for you or you can hinge with a flat back just ever so slightly to get that stretch through your hip this is great for your hips and your back so it might be tempting to round but i'd rather have you sit up nice and tall and hinge with that flat back going as far as you can to feel comfortable and like just get the stretch that feels good like hurts so good is what we want right not to pain not to discomfort just to the point of oh that feels good and then you would switch sides and do the same stretch on the other side and you'll probably notice one side feels a little tighter than the other that's why we want to make sure that we stretch and do pilates to keep things balanced in our bodies so that's stretch number two stretch number three is going to be a rotation for your spine so you're going to interlace your hands behind your head and bring your head back into your hands inhale rotate to one direction exhale back through center inhale other side exhale back through center so you notice this in your pilates workouts when we're seated on your mat and you can do it right here in a chair and you can do this anytime throughout the day to take a nice little break you might even decide to hold one side and drop one arm kind of holding onto your chair and either extending the top arm or kind of gently pushing against your thigh but the point here is to get into that long tall spine so we don't want to be rounded we want to be nice and long in our spine good and then you can do the same thing in the other direction good maybe ending with one last seated roll down letting go of tension shaking the arms a little bit and hopefully these stretches will help you to feel good throughout your day and remember to take movement breaks as well
