gas down over here oh yeah hey all right that's a part of the financial write-off yes no i'm just saying it's taking a long time okay today come here to my boy to do tent see what he say i need a wipe down or something i didn't know so let the santa clarita polling might be there oh yeah oh yeah give it to him oh yeah man i'm trying not to buy another ring man but that'll be sick right there that one of course it would want to go darker yeah we can remove the tin and go darker if you want to i mean it's kind of up to you at the end of the day you know you're the boss i mean he could go either way you go keep it the same shade or darkers you're getting used to like the darker shades right now that's why yeah you know that's just what i'm doing i just wanted like people can't see me on the freeway if i don't want to be seen yeah yeah what you think yeah if you don't want to be seen that we definitely got to go darker yeah yeah i think we should just leave that a little bit yeah we can just do all the sides in the background i think the is the background so the background the problem is the uh the frosting or whatever yeah i need to go get a wipe down or something yeah we just gotta steam it all off and then uh make sure that uh oh you would do the back too well i mean these won't look i mean i don't know because i remember last time you saying it might be an issue well the defrosters are yeah i'm just more concerned about you know this here it might look spotty once we remove the and even if we scrub it down we might need to uh maybe just leave it alone and just do the sides and just limo yeah yeah i agree because uh what happened with my wife's is on the amg we put the limo all the way around couldn't see out the back so we ended up doing this i think 30 or whatever yeah yeah yeah 20 i think this is this looks like 20. uh huh yeah so we can do this you gotta see it in the sun boy hit that oh come on [Music] dude every time i drive that mclaren with the grill now it's just something else now like i love the car even more because because they're looking because they're looking yeah you know they want to see who's in and then you smile on them yeah bro you know what i mean they look at it like damn that's cool yeah in this city after mothers who you think he is that money can't love that money kind oh god oh i come when i hear the money counter sweet sound look at him look at me oh [Music] oh yeah sweets uh let me hear more got you thank you that the blackwell fargo ones you ain't got them i need something special he laughed at my ring from the old dudes like cali cali jury he laughed at this ring man i got traded in turn it in man turn it in they put it in for you yeah yeah yeah it was what did you say it was just like knocking bro how do i go in bro like they were it was pretty intense it hurt that hurt oh yeah so what you you needed to put diamonds in some too huh yeah um was it the water the piece in the chain is missing like two how did you see it i can't see it it's one here on the and on the chain right here damn you got a good eyesight i can oh yeah i see it now yeah once you like when you look here like you won't see it but when i looked at it i saw it before was that it or the watch too no the watch wasn't missing so i'm thinking because i'm gonna feel bare with nothing on this hand so i'm thinking the ring for the same ring for this finger okay or what would you do on the same hand it's up to you you could always get it and then switch it that's what i told him oh that's what he was saying you see this yeah i don't know man i kind of want this hand to be hitting like that it looked kind of feminine to me when i tried those it's actually like a really good selling ring with the baguettes yeah so you i know you like the bigger styles tell me about like trend with it though like a lot of people everybody likes this style yeah the cuban the cuban rings yeah i like i like the of his knuckles damn but that on that hand but i feel naked callie y'all tried but but the youngsters right now know best y'all don't y'all don't follow rap you don't follow rappers hip hop ghetto dog you got to follow that stuff know what's going on man let me see this one fit perfect so i'll just make it this is good right i'll just show you the size let's see this little busted ring that you're embarrassed about you clown the cali jewelry like that man yeah they got the same name as me we just want to see you [Music] so this is a nine this right now is it 10 so when you go one side won't take that long like right here no it is it should be a little bit tight when you put it on it doesn't come out so easy so but the cold part is in the morning my hands be a little puffier yeah which i like because these be tighter which i like uh no i'm gonna rip this in the morning oh but my hands be fatter it's weird you know you wouldn't know it unless you wear jewelry you know what man you wouldn't notice so unless you wear jewelry man oh these are all like small stones right these like five of them is a carrot this it's like a hundred stones would be a carrot oh yeah oh okay so the pricing is different when it's bigger stones versus smaller stuff right what about oh yeah so something like this is like smaller because the bigger the stone is the easier it is to see the imperfections in it so when you go bigger and it's yes it gets more expensive right right all right get it man what you know what do i know this month i gotta drop 25 of my girl veneers so she went to my monthly hell yeah she went to my monthly uh lounge and spending you know what i mean oh and it's gonna be flooded yeah i dropped the 20s like this oh yeah yeah oh but the thing about it too is how thick it was it wasn't like this is this compared to that one yeah that one from the side like it stood up everything now what chain would you recommend with that [Music] like something like this side yeah it doesn't have to be like see this is a bigger point it has the bigger diamonds in it but something like this and this is the ones for how much see the difference this is like just a regular style setting this is three row with the big diamonds too so you could go like just like this but regular side stones would be a little bit less so i'm looking at what we say 40 or 50. about 50 because it's 20 plus 28 so let's say like high end for the piece 25 the chain about like 30. so you'll be around like 50 to 55. before i forget to give it to you how much is that two and i owe you 28. yeah and then just a piece give me like 30 45 minutes oh yeah no bro you know what i owe you 800 800 how much is this how wife oh he's doing it should so you need 40. yeah that's hot on you he's good every time oh good hey you know i used to sell that deed like it just come natural let me see if i can kind of like uh seen uh which come on [Laughter] all right very good come on [Music] hey so how much can this make like what this you can it depends what you're making you fill it change you could probably make like switzerland you see that you can make like three half a kilo change out of that is that right i'm gonna worry about that i know they make it all out of but this is like an investment and how much that go for this is 64 000. oh okay did you just put it in the save right better than having cash yeah well i don't know 64 000 in five years it's gonna be 64. yes in five years right it'll be a hundred thousand yeah papers always gonna be the same thing they're just getting it's getting weird man yeah yeah is that all i got
