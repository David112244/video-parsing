and everyone thinks that these are chemists or I'm pumping up there I'm not Katya I generally try I come home from the training camp I don't do anything at all, not dressing up, just that I'm a khayanu I go to the gym purely for boxing training I'm you master of sports of international class, the current champion of Russia now we'll show you how I train boxing is not only a warrior boxing is a whole life do you want to know what boxing breathes from the inside subscribe to the channel of the president of the international boxing association aiba umar kremlev and you will see how the organization of fights is going meeting with famous boxers and much more you will find all the links in the description under the video working with rubber first you need to warm up well do some stretching then do a serpentine well now I'll just show you how before the main training I work with ice rubber it can be different just like this I have now takes both rubber and we start drinking from the bottom up from the hand up then back this can be done until the muscles are tense you feel that the muscles are clogged or tired stop doing everything [applause] then like this you can these are the back muscles while we warm up we warm up the shoulders well  dollar in another [applause] at ten times exchange if before training before there during work it is necessary to warm up shoulders arms before training enough to hang once will do like this you can also do well with this rubber you can show a lot of different things well and and before training during warm-up what I do now I will show you can well here are other movements I go from well wrestlers also usually do this you can still many can say that you are not doing it correctly it is not good there but this is what I will do what I do before training I just showed [applause] also you can warm up the front muscle it is from below also for shoulders [applause] already such conversations [applause] here already these muscles work vigorously [applause] for warm-up I did now also work on a blow also and we while you can do from below Stalin became a rack and as usual could go a blow I do straight blows and you can so much having merged you can do your steadiness in a step you can just twist in place you can two times on the left group three times then pie back now side  side side blow goes well narrow such close combat you can hit like this you can hit like this and a little wide now while as a gift wide I will show the blow should go here the hand should stand correctly it is necessary if the hand is too twisted there your whole blow goes to that side if like this the hand also will not have such a blow if it is placed correctly so well put the hand correctly then you will already feel that it flew also on the left hands also after each blow during training you need to practice well hit necessarily need protection you little world there is a good aria back hit forward any protection after the blow must be present hit once protection hit twice protection hit three times protection protection can be a slope or a rock or just protection blog or there are two slopes or slopes rock or two slopes dive and or just a place there under tired or something does not work out you can hit and just grab the opponent everything and you rest so now we will show work as I do just with dumbbells but at do dumbbells can also be different depending on what weight light weight well you can even heavy heavy and do different dumbbells yourself first there as a warm-up there with light then with  heavy you can then generally without dumbbells in you can work out just how to put there now I'll just show you how it's just in front of the mirror overtraining I do here and there is left well not your stance here like this remembers a little frontal became I sit down a little and throw punches almost does not rise this is a mistake if you rise you can miss there you just need to turn from here hide your jaw and hit a punch and on the right also sat down a little on this block is also mandatory if here is a slope made you no block here for protection and you can when you hit you can miss from here therefore it is mandatory to put both your hand and the punch first single when we all sat down and this moment you need very quickly gnome instantly hits hard from here efforts and this is the slope made and everything is tough now you can two punches sele also and analysis and mandatory protection after the punch and also you can add from below side and add we will hit here for now we will do from below also he from below is also very important during the punch from below from sele a little with a slope you can not in any case raise your head it is very dangerous you can miss therefore the same as everyone or just twist the punch here and raise your hand they  hum you can add a side blow here ucun from below side her people and you can three blows another third blow ucun from below side side I did it now on the spot all during the fight during the fight with the shadow for example they move you approach from afar some deceptions and actions approached from here you can make a series there are different boxers some are tall for and for them it will not work well I what I did I am now showing I am short my revenge and and for tall ones there are a lot of different styles someone there is not on the shuttle work all the time back side twist just surrendered feces throw out hands but for me this boxing is not suitable in I thought that these opponents are taller than me and therefore I always practice close and medium distances well of course I work from a long distance I need to hit a tall one you need to approach there belly to start well here you can practice single blows 11 wounds there straight or there from below side single what I showed single from below and from the side what I showed their 2 wounds you can do died blow he left 1 2 school disassembled went straight side seam at  my who exchanged went from below side and left just 2 from below you can press and the third round with 3 blows already left 1 class book wars flora from you no he from below bottom side he from below side side any blows only with 3 3 blows for 3 rounds is enough even at home from childhood my father trained he did not let me go outside until I do 10 approaches to 30
