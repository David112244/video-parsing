hip bring the soles of the feet together so we're going to lift up through the chest again sit up on a blanket here if you feel like the spine is really falling you can also use your blocks in this shape because we're going to be here for a couple breaths to support your legs if you're feeling a deep stretch in the groin grab onto your ankles wherever you are sit up nice and tall again finding this big lift in the chest and relaxing the shoulders down breathe in here fill the belly with air we're going to do that two-part breath and fill the chest with air and then exhale out through the mouth good inhale fill the Belly Up Up Up then the chest keep breathing in in in and then empty it all out again big belly breath inhale sip in the air send the breath down down down and then fill the chest Breathe In Breathe In Breathe In and then exhale let it all go and one more time just like that inhale belly fill it up keep breathing in chest lungs expand and empty it all out good lift lift your heart send your gaze forward elbows back imagine you're looking down into a little Pond use your imagination here as you maybe see your own reflection and then let that go drop the chin to the chest round everything forward in your version of this cobbler's pose nice and easy breathing allowing the weight of the head now to release forward keeping the shoulders relaxed and going inward snuggling up to yourself to your own presence can take the thumbs to the arches of the feet give yourself a little foot massage then we'll tuck the chin bring awareness to the base of your spine that root chra and slowly roll it up through the belly through the Torso energy lifting up through the chest through the throat through the third eye or between your two brows and then all the way up through the crown of the head keep the feet active as we transition here you're going to send your hands to the right side and we're going to come into a pigeon so you're going to keep the right knee bent as you extend the left leg you can use your blanket or your blocks to prop your right H hip up excuse me look back at your left toes make sure that leg is aiming to be straight then inhale walk the fingertips back towards your hips lift your chest look up and then exhale come into the fold snuggle up with the sound of your breath as you relax the weight of your head over gently resting on your fingertips palms or forearms soften your heart close your eyes listen to the sound of your breath then slowly press up through the Palms come through keep active feet here just to keep nice and safe in those knees keep the feet engaged but we're all we're engaged we got this and we're going to send it to the back edge of the mat extend the right leg or just the opposite end of your mat extend the right leg out take a look at it again keep the feet engaged as you inhale walk the fingertips back towards the hips notice what it feels like on this side and then on an exhale we soften into it really present with the sound of our breath really getting cozy snuggling up to what it feels like to move through this journey maybe trusting being open to this idea that you are exactly where you're supposed to be that committing to this 30-day Journey does have meaning and purpose for you and all you have to do is make sure you keep showing up and then the rest we simply allow it to unfold take a couple more breaths here and then begin to slowly follow your breath to rise up keep the feet active as we come through across the ankles so we're going to take the blanket now and if you are in um depending on your temperature or your mood but if you're a little chilly you're going to roll up like a burrito in your blanket if you are warm you can roll your blanket up to serve as has a bolster underneath the knees like so if you were extra and you brought a pillow you can of course pillow the head if you're extra and you brought multiple blankets you can use one to put under the knees and one to Cozy up with definitely want you to get cozy here if you can I actually like my head on the ground so I can rock a little gently side to side once you get there find what feels good maybe you rock your head a little side to side maybe you hug the knees up to the chest but eventually I'd like us all to meet with our hands on the Torso one hand on the belly and one hand just above it we're going to end with some deep breath work so inhale again feel that inhalation travel all the way down to the low belly almost as if you were sending that breath down to take up some space in your hips just give it a try and then exhale Let It Go and again big low downward inhale and a slow and with control upward exhale inhale imagine a balloon in your belly so you feel the skin of the belly stretch as you breathe in and everything softens and Falls as the wave of the breath crests and you exhale out now just close your eyes and start to get in the habit of guiding your own Deep Breath Again working with that image of the balloon or sending the breath down to the belly then inhaling up through the chest deep diaphragmatic breathing here deep belly breathing two-part breath filling the belly then filling the chest and then emptying it out playing here you are your own best teacher for a minute or two good keep it going stay with it be disciplined about it snuggle up to the sound of your breath kick cozy with this relationship and especially if it's new you might notice that your thoughts start to wander and just keep coming back to this type of breathing and for this last bit stick with it just notice how your breath can move you literally physically but also just be open to being moved by your own sweet relationship to yourself via the breath today good and then gently begin to let that all go slowly float the fingertips all the way up and overhead really slow so you're taking a nice full body stretch from fingertips to toes start to move your tongue around and your mouth grab one wrist and then the other cross one ankle over the other and then switch then hug the knees up into the chest oh squeeze the knees up towards your heart and then we'll Rock to one side and come all the way up go ahead and put your blanket around your shoulders like the boss that you are self-care making it cool self-love making it more comfortable it's not always comfortable making this journey this process of understanding yourself better better knowing yourself better your own and I feel like it's hard enough as is so throwing in a snuggle day with yourself finding those cozy moments whe whether they're literal cozy moments or kind of metaphorical moments where you coziness metaphorical coziness what Adrien where you can just find softness and give yourself some Grace hopefully a tad bit of that resonates maybe it'll pop up and resonate later but thank you so much for being here you amaze me I cannot believe we are wrapping up this beautiful day 17 practice tomorrow is day 18 a beautiful one so don't miss it take a deep breath in and a long breath out to Bow the head to the heart and an invitation here to whisper namaste here [Music]
