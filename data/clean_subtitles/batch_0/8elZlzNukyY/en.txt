Hello everyone friends in this issue we will consider the main current news of the world to you and the president to her all dana white responded to criticism his address and the next opponent of khamzat chumakov gerald world sorta who said that it is very ugly from the side and and all prepare khamzat one more goal October with the domain and and until their fight took place I said to give him two fights one in las vegas one on the fighter sharp and in the end he will perform both times here I do not know why it happened but it does not matter to me it suits me the fact is that he wants to fight wants to have a fight one after another this is not disrespect to the opponent he will lose ripa sees it is none of our business this video if he wants to plan two fights then this needs to be done and for any other fighter I would not do this I would say relax let's see how the next one goes on the single but after I saw his two past fights I want to make exceptions for him you have never seen such a fighter in fact a rather strange answer from white and he himself makes it clear like khamzat rather  all ukrainians will fry but does not consider it disrespectful to say something and all presents gerald caviar sacrifices adan this is actually not hidden by the way hamzat himself has already flown to las vegas on september 19 will be his boyfriend and there I will remind that the choice of the whole winner in the fight hamza gerald we will receive a coefficient on the game market and raise money on his won you can our partners lanvin and on the promo code then on my when registering you can get a bonus of up to 50,000 rubles for 1 replenishment all information and a link in the first pinned comments under this video contender for the middleweight belt and all on lacoste made a pretty funny parody of the upcoming fight with a real description and remember that in the last fight des they with the size of the foot and including the cost himself considered that israel avoided the fight that actually cost and decided to exploit [music] [ music] [music] about [music] [applause] Russian fighter Mogu Smailov made an interesting statement that he allegedly wants to take revenge on everyone who defeated Alexander Shlemenko every time when Khimenko defeated someone I wanted to beat this one what you all remember we will be by force when Bruce Ustimenko I immediately challenged I said I want to resolve the issue myself but he ran away too moment table they a little later similar situation that's what it turns out in the end it turns out there is another athlete honey to whom Shlemenko let down by a unanimous decision of the judges that's when I saw this confrontation I dusted and rolled to victory and I why don't you know. someone showed so it turns out he signed and you insane olson signed with her for I open the hunt for Chris the hamster he can also do the same as Talia and was populated to avoid you we can but it's good that he knew how contract with so there's nowhere to run Shlemenko himself responded to this statement magic interview with channel sport 24 and what else to say who is the peasants for the Russian viewer before they need to say but to be honest we replace the degrees it is necessary especially you know you can watch that fight something there you know if you watch Magi fight with Alexander Mil and he beat him there a whole face there is a cut there crazy then because of the fight but trivially really I can say there has already been detained for lying on or some other moments but if Maga wants to lie down Chris the guard then please let it do I have no really not some kind of claims some other Chris you know I have claims to myself I made another mistake and mistakes need to be corrected we are not that's all I'm not used to someone wanting to do something for me  you actually don't even know what to say and but the return of the scandalous fighter and and all of Nick Diaz who hasn't given in for almost six years has provoked a wave of reactions from the fighters and mom a huge number of top welterweight fighters and and everyone is already trying to get hype and without Nick and have put forward their candidacies for this fight also seems interested in a fight with Nick Conor McGregor who commented on a fresh photo of the Diaz brothers from the gym McGregor wrote put them in line remind that Conor and the Diaz brothers have a long history of confrontation Conor has had two fights with Nate so far they have a score of 1 1 McGregor has repeatedly stated that it is imperative to complete the trilogy with her there nevertheless really Conor is interested in a rematch with this somehow doubtful if he wanted to hold a trilogy he would have held it this year too and now I remind you a fight is being developed between Jorge at this end of this year but in fact with Nick it would have been cool  of course, considering that as a fighter, probably, he won't be a little better at this and he has the same good cardio jaw as his younger brother, for Conor, it will be a pretty tough fight if he doesn't manage to finish Rudnik in the first rounds, but on the other hand, we have no idea in what shape Nick will go out for his first fight after a layoff, after all, 6 years without fights is a lot, besides, all this time, he didn't really train much, but walked around, used different substances, so how Scarce is so huge, a layoff during which he has n't maintained his shape yet, it's hard to say, but from the point of view of hype, Bike, he's a remake, it's hard to hold on, that's for sure, and the promotion would be very bright, by the way, in the meantime, the younger brother doesn't have a chance, I'll throw a stone at Nurmagomedov again, find him, and I decided to answer the welterweight fighter, is he Edwards, who said that Jorge also said that it doesn't make sense, since Jorge would again arrange a beating for Diaz, and he answered the next one, you were beaten for  behind the scenes for trying to look cool it's fighting crap it's the same thing it doesn't matter in the cage or outside it don't let yourself get screwed wherever you are the same goes for x woman you guys are now in last place let me remind you that the hobby conflict you have been doing this for a very long time as soon as the hobby appeared in her all one of his main goals was a fight with on this Diaz who was already a pretty popular fighter then Khabib actively trolled on this social networks trying to provoke him into a fight and when on these they met as spectators at one of the tournaments of the then promotion WFF a squabble quickly ensued between them after which it escalated into a mass brawl between Khabib's and her teams to get not ideas of course also took part in this mess well and last year between on this and Khabib again there was almost a skirmish at one of the tournaments her in blue passed by Khabib's seat of his team and began to provoke Nurmagomedov but of course everyone was quickly calmed down  these all with this case everything is serious also last year on their stated that he asked her all fight with khabib and the promotion allegedly was not delighted with this fight in fact of course in the octagon for this little chance against khabib considering that wrestlers are his main weakness but it is worth admitting that the promotion of this fight would be very bright that's what I am sure of exactly this is that we will never see khabib's fight and on this in the cage if somewhere once it was more real for me and in general the place now the fight with nate went will give absolutely nothing except a small portion of extra hype the same rematch with conor mcgregor sounds more realistic the only thing that I would not exclude is a brawl between khabib and on this outside the octagon for example if they meet somewhere behind the scenes you know gentlemen go and there are places even lower yes I remember everything [music] his family for them family is a weakness from for me family is strength his business I can  you on his empire teeth we will get anyone anywhere this is our city Russians know as you know we are very dangerous people we will take a lot from their throats and they will crush us do not fight do not fight do not fight do not fight excellent one on one with you gave out need ah you be
