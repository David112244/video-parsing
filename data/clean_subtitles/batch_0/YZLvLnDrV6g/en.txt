We decided to remember these legendary players of the Netherlands national team by preparing for you the top best Dutchmen in the history of football, and before we move on to the main part of the video, we invite you to take part in our traditional question. Who would be the best scorer of the Netherlands national team at Euro 2020? Georgi Niu-Venaldo Donil Malin Leave your answer in the comments under this video. And we begin. Rud Van Mistelrooy, a Dutch central striker, began his career in modest youth academies in his homeland at the age of 15. Van Mistelrooy became part of the Dutch team's youth team. Dan Bosch made his debut for the main team three years later, as part of which he could declare himself as a very promising young man with an excellent scoring instinct already. In 1997, his  noticed the Dutch club Heaven and already in the summer of 1998 did not become Roy bought PSV in his debut season for PSV you did not become Roy scored 41 goals and gave 10 assists in forty-six matches with a result of 31 goals of the Division Rud became the top scorer of the Dutch championship and the best player of the country of course such a game did not go unnoticed in 2001 Manchester United bought the 25-year-old striker moving to Foggy Albion became a decisive factor in the fate of the Dutch footballer under the leadership in the first season became the main striker of the devils and scored 23 goals in 22 matches of the Premier League the next draw of the Premier League became the best in the career of Rud the Dutchman not only won the English championship but also became its top scorer and player of the season Unfortunately injuries began to torment the Dutch forward Evangelie so the club acquired young Wayne Rooney as a backup Rud at 30 years old did not become Roy moved to Real Madrid but this was already a real sunset of his career  in the first season of the cream he became the top scorer of La Liga and the champion of Spain, Real took the championship the following season, but Root himself no longer played a big role in 2010, he moved to Magoo for a season and then moved to Hamburg, where he ended his career at the age of 36, a separate story of Roy's performance did not become for his national team Despite the fact that Root played for the Netherlands for 13 years, he managed to play only 70 official matches in which he scored 35 goals. Frequent injuries were to blame for long-term recovery, however, despite all the adversity, he did not become Roy. These are the best scorers of the national team in history and also the record holder for goals scored by the Netherlands at the European Championships. The Dutchman is remembered by everyone as a perfect penalty area player, capable of lightning-fast hitting the opponent's goal not only with his right foot but also with his head. Robin van Persie is another central striker, a remarkable finisher. Van Persie's fate is in many ways similar to Van's career. nesteroya The Flying Dutchman scored one of the most beautiful goals in the history of the World Cup in the style of a fish, which also became a meme But of course, he scored most of the goals with his left foot At 5 years old, Robin became a player in the youth team of the Dutch club Excel And after 8 years he moved to the Feyenoord Academy At the age of 17, Van Persie made his debut for the main team for which As a result, he lost three seasons, scoring 14 goals in 31 matches, not so much, but then he was not yet a central striker, but a left winger Also, in their homeland, they managed to become the owner of the UEFA Cup And also the Dutch Cup and Super Cup The next stage is leaving for England, moving to London's Arsenal Van Persie became a main player in his first season, although in foggy Albion he scored so much as Divisions at first that he was no longer on the flank for the center forward position For a long time, Van Perse was in the shadow of Yuri Andrey, but after the transfer of the French to Barcelona, ​​it was Robin who became the main finisher  Gunners truth no matter how good Van Persie was At the tip of his goals could not bring Arsenal anything except one FA Cup and the Super Cup of the country in 8 full seasons, so the Dutchman made a difficult decision to move to Manchester United in pursuit of some achievements the devils just needed a striker capable of scoring a lot of swords and Robin accomplished this task in his first season for United Van Persie scored 26 goals in the Premier League, becoming the champion of England And also the top scorer and the best player of the season in the Premier League the next two seasons were much worse because Van Persie was already 30 years old he was haunted by constant serious injuries the next 3 years he spent in Turkey playing for Fen and then shook off the old days in his city became great in 2010 he, together with the Netherlands, was one step away from the gold medal of the World Cup, but the Spaniards were stronger in extra time in 2014 at the Brazilian World Cup he took the bronze medal, beating the hosts of the tournament together with his team in the match For third place in Antvers is the best scorer of the Netherlands national team in history with 50 goals scored in 102 matches, Depay has 8 left to catch up with Robin Arjen is another Great Dutchman who, like Ivan Percy, made everyone fall in love with his left foot, Aren began his journey in the Netherlands at the Groning club, even then his speed, signature shift from the right flank to the center of the field and a curling shot into the far nine did not go unnoticed, therefore, in 2002, eighteen-year-old Robin was bought by PSV as part of the red and whites, Arjen immediately began to show a high level of play, becoming the champion of the division, the owner of the Dutch Super Cup, despite the serious injury rate for the young footballer, Chelsea desperately needed to buy Robin, the beginning of the season, Argen sat out due to another injury, but then he was able to become a solid player in the starting lineup for the pensioners, he played 106 matches in which he scored 19 goals and gave 21 assists to Robin in three seasons took six trophies with Chelsea, including two English championships, after which the Dutch noticed Real Madrid and already in August Robin became a player, the form itself became football emotions, a five-year contract lasted much less in Real. The fault again became the injuries of the Dutch winger, which in Madrid he received on average every 5 days, in two seasons he played less than half of the matches. Although his performance was always at a very high level and recovery as such was not required for him, in his maturity he played 65 games in which he scored 13 goals and made 15 assists, becoming the champion of Spain and the owner of the country's Super Cup. In 2009, Real bought Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Robin was put up for sale at the end of the transfer window, he was bought by Bayern, although the Dutchman himself was clearly upset by his departure from Madrid. It is unlikely that Arjen himself thought that it was in Germany that he would realize himself 100%, in Bavaria he spent 10 seasons, taking 21 trophies among them.  eight Bundesliga championships five German Cups one gold and two silver medals in the Champions League simply phenomenal for the national team Robin scored 37 goals in ninety-six games and also became a bronze medalist in 2014 and took Silver at the World Cup in South Africa he has always been one of the best at international championships having entered the history of his country as a Magnificent Winger who makes everyone fall in love with his game Frank de Boer the first defender in our top de Boer got into the Ajax Youth Team at a very young age he played for the Academy for a long time but at the age of 18 he became part of the main team since Frank was the most versatile left-footed defender he always found a place in the starting lineup due to the fact that he was good both in the center of defense and on the left flank in addition to this, Burati personally joined the attacks and often helped his team either play the ball or directly score goals The dawn of his career came at Ajax Amsterdam 10 years of his adult life Frank devoted his life to this club for such a long period of time, he won the Dutch championship five times, twice lifted the country's cup above his head, and in 1992 he won the UEFA Cup, and in 1995 he also won the Champions League, the age of which de Boer fairill in Amsterdam, in Barcelona, ​​the Dutch defender spent almost five seasons, but during this time he only won the title of champion of Spain, the blue-garnets were then in a great storm, and the story with the suspicion of depur due to doping, which, although it turned out to be unfounded in the end, still left a bad feeling, led to Franco's move to Galatasaray in Turkey, he played only one season, then moved to the Scottish Rangers, and after that he played out several seasons in Qatar and hung up his boots, de Boer's international career largely did not work out due to a combination of circumstances at Euro 1992 and the World Cup 1990  On the fourth he was a bench player and missed the Euro ninety-sixth due to injury but Frank completely rehabilitated himself at the World Cup ninety-eighth year being not only the leader but also the captain of the team although he was a defender his effective actions helped the team take the fourth place in the Netherlands as a whole having scored 13 goals this is the third highest indicator of matches played for the national team in history a good replacement for Frank de Boer was Giovan Ivan Bronkhorst they both played on the left flank of defense but Van Bronkhorst was still more of an attacking player as soon as de Boer left Barca the Catalans bought Giovanni in the national team almost always played left back he also managed to play for the Netherlands team more than 100 matches Van Bronkhorst is a real legend of his country having taken fourth place with the national team in the ninety-eighth year at the World Cup and also taking bronze at Euro 2000 and 2004  in 2010, together with the team, he took second place at the World Cup Denis Berg if Van Persie was called the Flying Dutchman, then up Hunt went down in football history as not the Flying Dutchman it's not about his bad heading, Denis had no problems with that, he was just very afraid of heights Yes, not just afraid, he was overcome by panic attacks But on the field, he was braver than many Berg Hump started in the Ajax Youth Team, it was in Amsterdam that he achieved great success and earned himself a name as one of the most talented footballers of his generation, her amazing play as an attacking midfielder or a withdrawn forward was accumulated by subtle and smart passes, as well as excellent dribbling and excellent technique, Denis debuted at the age of 17 and gave Ajax a total of 7 years of his life, scoring 121 goals, giving 23 assists in 238 matches, this is simply fantastic statistics, as for a playmaker, he became the champion of the Netherlands, twice won the country's cup  and raised the UEFA Cup over his head three more times he won the Golden Boot twice became the best player of the Netherlands in the ninety-third Berkamp moved to Inter although the best clubs in Europe of that time were hunting for him including Real but Blood talked him out of it and he would move to Spain In addition, the Dutchman dreamed of playing in Italy the dream came true but in practice everything turned out to be not so romantic Inter then plunged into a crisis changing coaches one after another and Berkham had a hard time adapting to the defensive Italian football after two years he left for London Arsenal which a month after Denis's transfer Wenger took charge the Dutchman caught the dawn of the Wenger era of the gunners the Londoners were then a very strong team that was capable of giving heat to everyone together with Arsenal Denis three times in 11 years became the champion of England and four times the winners of the FA Cup during all this time he scored 115 goals and gave 95 assists he also ended his career in an Arsenal T-shirt A  after was included in the English Football Hall of Fame by the national team Berkomplekt showed himself excellently at Euro 92, taking a place in the symbolic team of the tournament, but the Netherlands then took only bronze medals in Europe at the World Cup in 1998, up Ham also lit up, but his team lost in the semi-finals, the Dutchman made his debut late, therefore, he played for his country for only 10 years, however, during this time, he managed to score 37 goals, which makes him the fifth on the list of the Netherlands' top scorers in history. Wesley Sneijder, a Dutch attacking midfielder, started out in the Ajax Youth Team. He made his debut for Sneijder's main team at the age of 18, thanks to his amazing field control, ability to pass with both feet, and first-class execution of standards. Wesley quickly turned from a talented teenager into a main player for Sjax. In 5 seasons, he was able to become the champion of the Netherlands, taking two national cups and three super cups, but in the second half of the 2000s, the Amsterdam team began to decline, so Wesley decided to take advantage of his  reputation as a great dispatcher and moved to the Madrid series in just 180 matches for Yaks in which he scored 58 times against opponents and made 47 assists in Madrid in his first season Sneijder became the champion of Spain providing very high-quality football the second season for Wesley was not so successful and in the summer Real, as in the case of Robin, carried out a serious purge due to the strengthening of the squad with expensive footballers, so Sneijder also found himself on the sidelines and was forced to look for a new club it became the one coached by Jose Mourinho the stars aligned so that in his first season in the series Sneijder immediately won trable forever inscribing his name in the history of world football he performed magnificently both in the Champions League and in the Italian championship but the departure of the Portuguese from the coaching chair introduced an interface and Sneijder, although he showed a high level, did not win anything anymore so at the age of 33 he moved to Galatasaray after 5 seasons in Turkey he also played in Italy and Qatar and then finished his Sneijder's long career holds the Netherlands national team's record for matches played. The Dutchman has 134 games under his belt, scoring 31 goals and making 32 assists. He was a bronze medalist at EURO 2004. He took third place with the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and was one step away from winning the 2010 World Cup, winning the Silver and Bronze Boot. The tournaments changed a whole generation of players, but he successfully withstood any competition. He is definitely one of the best playmakers in the history of the Netherlands. And just recently we released a video from this section, where we talked about the best Brazilians and also the French. Who has n't had time to watch it yet? We recommend you Edwin van der Sar. The legendary Manchester United goalkeeper took a long time to mature for big football, but How successful was his future fate? Edwin under 20  years played for modest youth teams in his homeland, but then he was noticed and called by the Vojax for Amsterdam Van der Sar played almost until he was 30 years old, becoming a four-time champion of the Netherlands, winner of the UEFA Cup and the Champions League in 9 seasons. And he became the best goalkeeper of the country four times in total during his entire stay in Ajax in Andersar won 14 trophies, having played 259 matches for Amsterdam. He moved to Turin Juventus, although before that he almost ended up in Liverpool or Manchester United. He insisted on the transfer of the Dutchman on his own, as in the Netherlands in 2001 the Turin team bought the young Buffon, which meant that Edwin no longer had a chance to be a starting player. Not wanting to wipe his shorts on the bench, the Dutch goalkeeper still moved to England, but not to a top club, but to Fulham. He defended the taskmasters in the framework for 4 full seasons, but won. only one Anton Cup Trophy soon various clubs began to contact the Dutch again But this time Edwin decided not to refuse Sir Alex and moved to Manchester surprisingly, at the time of his move to United, Andersar was already 35 years old make up the devils for six seasons he was the team's main goalkeeper demonstrating at the same time almost his best game together with United he took the English championship four times and won the Champions League in total in foggy Albion in Andersar won 11 trophies and only at the age of 41 ended his professional career He is still one of the best goalkeepers What can I say if even the best goalkeeper Along with Peter for the Netherlands, Edwin lost 13 years and 130 matches he ranks second in the top of the national team's record holders for matches played, second only to Sneijder Amazingly, for such a long period of time no one could displace van der Sar From the starting lineup, Mark Van Basten now we move on to  star old men Van Basten, unlike most of his colleagues in our top, played for only two teams in his entire adult career. His childhood was spent in the youth teams of Utrecht. And at the age of 17, he joined the academy of You won't believe it. It took him only one season to become part of the main team, for which Mark ultimately lost 6 years as part of the Amsterdam team. Van Basten showed a simple, luxurious game, scoring in almost every match with Ajax. The Dutch central striker was three times the champion of the Netherlands and the winner of the country's cup. For four seasons in a row, Mark was recognized as the best scorer of the year in his homeland. But the main achievement is undoubtedly the golden boot that Ivan Baston received in 1986. In total, he scored 152 goals for Yax plus 34 assists. In 172 games in the summer of 1987, the Dutchman received an offer to recruit top players there to mow down Ivan Basten. 36 of his goals were recorded. But after watching 14, I realized that Marco is urgently needed.  buy otherwise he will be intercepted in Milan Bondbaston won everything he could only dream of four Italian championship titles two European Champions Cups before That was the name of the current Champions League there are still a lot of team trophies of which in total there were 14 over 8 years But in addition to collective achievements, it was in Italy that Mark revealed himself as a formed first-class scorer playing for Milan took three golden balls and became the player of the year according to FIFA Despite the fact that the Italian championship was much more difficult than the Dutch Van Bastam practically did not lose his danger on his account 125 goals and 49 assists in 2001 for the national team He played less than many of his colleagues having brought only 58 matches in the Netherlands shirt but in them he scored 24 years and what makes him successful most other Dutch footballers in Europe in 88 And even to become the top scorer of the tournament certainly Marco van Basten was an excellent Gaador not for nothing because he is included in the top 100 best football players on the planet according to FIFA Rutgulid Captain  golden generation of the national team of the Netherlands Gulit was an extremely versatile footballer who was simply impossible to replace tall, powerful, with an accurate shot, Rut could play in the center of the attack and even in the support zone because of his lush long hair, the Dutchman received the nickname Black Tulip Gulit and Van Basta were recruited at the same time But their international careers are still not similar Rut played in the position of an attacker or, more simply, a withdrawn forward True, he also performed well on the right flank of the attack, breaking through defenders at speed Trud gained intelligence in the Youth team of the once professional club DVS but at the age of 17 he moved to the Academy of Haarlem A season later he became part of the base for which he lost three years And became the winner of the first division a modest small team, so the ambitious Gulit moved with which in two seasons he became the champion or Division and the winner of the Dutch Cup in total, the southerner played 103 matches in which he scored 41 goals with 11 assists and was also recognized  player of the year in the Netherlands in 1985 for a ridiculous sum he moved to PSV, where he won the title of Winner twice in two seasons, he again became the best footballer of the year  ana and the owner of the Golden Boot of the Netherlands fps his often had to play finishers therefore in 75 matches he 59 times broke the opponents' goal giving 29 assists such crazy statistics did not go unnoticed already in the eighty-seventh year together with Van Bast Gulit productively dined with the same Berlusconi and joined Milan plays for Rosanerit in his first season took the Golden Ball and also became the athlete of the year of the Netherlands and the best footballer in the world according to magazines her his arsenal three championships of the Italian championship destructive but in 94 32-year-old Gulit went to Sampdoria managed to win only the Italian Cup which in Milan he never conquered the last club refuge of Gulit was Chelsea at that time the Londoners were the middle peasants of the English championship Samrut was never able to adapt to the specifics of British football in three seasons scored only seven goals Although he managed to win with the pensioners  FA Cup at 35 He retired from Big football But the career of Van Paston and Rood Gould is completely similar to the Dutch national team, they were both the backbone of their country's attack, which allowed the Netherlands to take that same Euro 1988 Gould was the captain of his national team, devoting 13 years to it, for which he played 66 matches and scored 17 goals Johan Cruyff Blood was more than just a good footballer, he was born in Amsterdam, from a very early age he began attending the Ajax Academy at 17, he was transferred to the main team, in which he immediately began to show himself as an excellent and subtle attacking player, Johan's career falls on the 60s and 70s of the last century, so his position was, let's say, unusual, especially when compared to modern times, Blood played a kind of floating striker not tied to the center of the penalty area, that is, in his position he could be on the flank and even in midfield. Surprisingly, he had such a set of qualities that it turned out to be quite within his power  he passed well, knew how to get around opponents at speed, hit from afar and was simply an amazing dreamer, they even named the feint heel blood in his honor Johan lost as an adult in an Ajax shirt for 9 seasons and became a real star eight times he raised the title of the winner on his head five times the Dutch Cup and together with the Amsterdam team he took apart the European Champions Cup, it was while playing for the Amsterdam club that Cruyff earned himself a reputation as the strongest player of that time, which is confirmed by his personal achievements in the Netherlands he received the Golden Ball twice and was also recognized as the Footballer of the Year twice And of course, we cannot fail to mention his inexplicable productivity only in three seasons out of nine he scored less than 20 goals per season in one he even scored as many as 33 goals in total for Jaxon he scored 191 goals in 238 games after Ajax the Dutchman moved to Barcelona at that time he was already 26 not so much but the blood will adapt to Spanish football How should not be able The Catalans were clearly not in the best shape then Although one championship and one Spanish Cup still Johan took at the age of 31 the Dutchman left for the USA then returned to Spain after he played out his last matches hare last season he spent a conflict with the management of Amsterdams which caused the next furor in the football community for the national team of the Netherlands Blood won the silver medal of the 74 World Cup and took bronze at Euro-76 he played only 48 matches for the national team but scored 33 goals in them his contribution to the game is difficult to overestimate since according to many of his colleagues on the national team He often took on the functions of a real leader and assistant coach manage their compatriots right on the field this is not surprising because after finishing his career as a football player Johan Kroev became the founder of an entire tactical system but already in the coaching field in our top not many first-class players among whom I would like to note the ex-coach of Barca ronald koeman franco ryder and of course van der vaart in the modern team there are also many players who in the future can become new legends for example frankie and what do you think which of the modern dutch football players will forever go down in the history of football of their country write options in the comments under this video we will be interested [music]
